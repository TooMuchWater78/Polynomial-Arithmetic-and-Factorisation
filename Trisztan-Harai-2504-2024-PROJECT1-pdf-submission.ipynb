    "The relevant input values are `N = 1000` and `N_prods = 20`. Looking at `rand(::Polynomial)`, we see that the vast majority of randomly generated polynomials will have degree between 0 and 10. Thus, with `N_prods = 20`, the maximum degree of the polynomial generated in the inner for loop via multiplication will be about 200. This is less than the original `max_degree_allowed` of `400`, but larger than the new `100`. Therefore, the created polynomial has degree too high and an error is thrown.\n",

The change was made in commit 26 in the repo, and the files `poly_factorization_project.jl`, `polynomial.jl` and `term.jl` were edited."
